ExData_Plotting2
================
This repository contains files for Project 2.

This repo contains a 'CodeBook.md' file describing how the script 'run_analysis.R' works to merge and tidy up a few data files, and also where those raw data files are to be downloaded.

An output file 'tidy_data.txt' is included as well.

For a detailed explanation of the raw data, look in the info and readme files included in the raw data ZIP file.
Creation of the dataset

    The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

    The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

Cleaning the dataset

The dataset is cleaned up through processes described in the code book included in this repository.

These processes are made and commented in the file run_analysis.R.
