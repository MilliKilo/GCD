Purpose: Create 2 tidy data sets from the UCI HAR Dataset.
Tidy Data Set 1:

The first tidy data set is: meanstdData
This data set is 180 rows and 81 columns. The values in each column are various measures per subject and activity. 
The values are obtained by combining all of the column s of data in train and test data (subject, y, and X) , 
and then combining the rows on train and test data to create 1 single data frame. A column for activityLabels was 
then added by matching IDâ€™s to labels from activity_labels.txt.

The following lists all of the columns in meanstdData

    [1] "Subject"                      "Activity"                     "tBodyAccmeanX"

Tidy Data Set 2 :

The second tidy data set is: tidy_data.txt

This data set is 180 rows and 81 columns. The values in each column are the mean measures per subject and activity. The 
column names are identical to those described above (see Tidy Data Set 1). The data from Tidy Set 1 was transformed by 
grouping on subject ID and activity, and then the mean value for each measure was calculated.
Program PsuedoCode:

1) Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.

    Determine column names by loading features.txt
        use make.names() function to make syntactically valid column names
    Load the Y, X, and Subject data
        Load Train Data:
        Load Test Data:
    Merge all 6 of the datasets:
        Combine columns of all 3 Train datasets
        Combine columns of all 3 Train datasets
        Combine rows of Train and Test datasets

2) Extract only the measurements involving mean or standard deviation for each measurement

    Create subset of column names
    Create subset of data.frame

3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities

    Load Activity Labels:
    Join activityLabels with meanstdData

4) Appropriately label the data set (columns) with descriptive activity names

    Create list of column names to be re-labelled
    
    Save this first tidy data set to file: meanstdData

5) Create a second, independent tidy data set:

    Average of each combination of variable, activity and subject
    Determine 'measure' columns (i.e. remove "subjectID", "activityID", "activityLabel")
    Melt 'measure' columns into new dataframe
    Create a list of groups
    Check: length(lstGroups) = 20 subjects x 6 activities x 86 variables = 15480
    Join back subjectID, activityLabel, and variable columns
    Reshape for better appearance
    Cols: Subject, Activity, activityLabel,
    Save this dataframe to file: tidy_data.txt
